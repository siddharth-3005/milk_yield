Milk Yield Prediction:
   This project involves predicting the milk yield of the cow based on different parameters. Three different approaches were used. First, we imputed the null values by median and 
   performed
   outlier treatment and built models. Next, we imputed the null values by KNN imputer and performed power transformer on the entire dataset before training test split and building the model. 
   Last
   we used the median imputed dataset and performed power transformer after train test split and build model.
   Predominantly used Linear regression algorithm to build models
